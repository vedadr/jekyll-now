Data Mining

The current technological trends lead to data flood. Every day more and more data is generated from banking, telecom, scientific experiments, biology, world wide web, business transactions etc. The data amounts grow very fast and very little of it will ever be looked at by a human. Data mining is therefore used to make sense and use of that data. 
Data mining is an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science. It is the computational process of discovering patterns in data sets involving methods at the intersection of artificial intelligence, machine learning, statistics, and database systems. Simply put it means that data mining is a process of uncovering hidden patterns in the data that previously have not been discovered. Data mining is used to predict future trends and behaviors, allowing people to make proactive, knowledge-driven decisions. 
The manual extraction of patterns from data by statisticians has occurred for centuries. Advances in computer technology has dramatically increased ability to collect, store, and manipulate data. 
While it seems almost obvious, but there are two things that must exist in order to run successful data mining project, data and patterns inside of the data.  Usually, sample of data is taken from the whole dataset. Then this sampled data is prepared and feed into the data mining algorithm which uses mathematical, statistical etc. techniques to find patterns in the data. After that, this new knowledge is applied to the rest of the data.

Real life application

DM can be used in wide variety of fields such as:
Medicine 
Finance
Healthcare
Bioinformatics 
Retail Industry
Telecoms etc.
In medicine data mining is used to improve accuracy in disease diagnostic, predict outcome for given treatment, recommend best treatment, predict possibility for cancer etc. 
Data mining tools can answer business questions that traditionally were too time consuming to resolve. Because of that it is also used in almost every aspect of modern businesses such as advertising, customer modeling and CRM (Customer Relationship management), e-Commerce, investments, manufacturing and many other. 
Interest in data mining techniques comes also from government where it can be used, among other things, for anti-terrorism efforts, profiling tax cheaters or prevent money laundering.
It’s most intensively used in CRM where organizations can build models based on historical data to predict who will respond to the new marketing campaigns such as direct mail, online marketing campaign. Also, financial institutions are most common users of DM where banks can by building a model from historical customer’s data, determine between good and bad loans.

Disadvantages and limitations

There are three main potential issues with DM:
Privacy issues
Misuse of information
Data Accuracy
Since data mining requires large amounts of data to be useful, collecting and storing those data can raise serious privacy issues. Privacy is an issue that is debated in the last 10-15 years, and it is likely that it will continue to be debated in the future. These days information is currency, and in the information age, it sometimes seems as if everyone wants to know everything their customers. One of the key issues raised by data mining technology is not a business or technological one, but an issue of individual privacy. Technologies such as data mining will make it possible for businesses, governments etc. to track all our movements and purchasing habits.
Another concern is misuse of information. Information is collected through data mining intended for the ethical purposes can be misused. The problem can arise if organizations or governments decide that this data can be used in ways that users didn't approved or businesses to take benefits of vulnerable people or discriminate against a group of people.
Also, there is the issue of how correct data mining methods are. If data mining is used in decision process for e.g. loan application,  people could be written off as undesirable, whether the depiction is correct or not. It can happen very easily for customer credit report to have errors, and those errors can lead to difficulty getting a loan or other type of credit. Without any way to look at our consumer profiles, people have no idea what bankers and other interested parties make their decisions.


Trends in development

In last few years this technology is rapidly developing. It established itself as one of the major disciplines in computer science with growing impact. Undoubtedly, research in data mining will continue and even increase over coming decades
Application of DM in more areas is expected in the future, and some of them are:
Hypertext And Hypermedia Data Mining
Distributed/Collective Data Mining
Spatial And Geographic Data Mining 
Graph mining
Image Mining
Text mining etc.
Developments in distributed computing will allow future data miners to use grater amounts of data faster and with more precision.
These days, biggest improvement is in the fields of multimedia mining (image, video etc.). Also, with improvements in graph mining (graph theory) search engines are getting better in personalized searches, social services such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn are better in linking people. 

Conclusion

Data mining brings a lot of benefits to businesses, society, governments. Practical applications are almost limitless and can be used virtually everywhere where there is some value in predicting outcome. New techniques and tools are reducing complexity in application and maintenance of DM.
 On the other hand, it will require proper handling of the mentioned issues for it to be fully useful in the future.
